# Arch-Cleaner

<br />

>Script to clean your archlinux. Removal of the yogurt, pacman and flatpak cache. Update of mirrors compared to the most efficient French servers. The script cleans up directories which can be automated but does not take configuration files into account. Since this is sensitive data, I advise you to do it by hand. I provide in the description the list of directories to check to remove the remainder of your applications.
